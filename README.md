# TheRunner
A bunch of programming jokes and nonsense related to the go90 show The Runner.

Files are put into a SVG created in Inkscape, the text is then manually syntax-highlighted with the base16 color scheme, and exported to a PNG. Most of these will get posted onto my Twitter [\@retrocraft314](http://twitter.com/retrocraft314). Feel free to PR a new one.
