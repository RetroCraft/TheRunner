# TheRunner
A bunch of programming jokes and nonsense related to the go90 show The Runner.

Files are put into a SVG created in Inkscape, the text is then manually syntax-highlighted with the base16 color scheme, and exported to a PNG. Most of these will get posted onto my Twitter [@retrocraft314](http://twitter.com/retrocraft314). Feel free to PR a new one.

## Pull Requests
Please make sure the joke will semi-get understood by other non-programmers. Also don't do any obfuscated unreadable code. I know the following languages:
- C++
- C#
- Java
- JavaScript
- a bit of Python

So if it's not in one of those, I might have to do some googling before accepting it :)

## Larger Projects
If you want to make a huge Java package or something, feel free and do it. This can be a hub for all The Runner programming insanity. I don't care.
